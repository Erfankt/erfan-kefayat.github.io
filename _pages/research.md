## Dissertation Research

### Spatio-Temporal Study of Sustainable Urban Morphology

My dissertation examines whether and how **urban morphology** has evolved toward greater sustainability over time using a longitudinal, data-driven framework.

**Study Area:** Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (1990–2023)

**Core contributions:**
- Development of quantitative urban morphology indicators (e.g., density, compactness, street hierarchy)
- Longitudinal spatial–temporal analysis of urban form change
- Integration of clustering, time-series modeling, and spatial statistics

**Methods:**
- Spatial–temporal clustering (e.g., ST-DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering)
- Time-series analysis and trend detection
- Kernel density estimation and spatial regression
- Large-scale parcel, street network, and building data processing

This research contributes a reproducible framework for evaluating long-run urban sustainability at fine spatial and temporal resolutions.
